## Application of Markov chain in infectious disease dynamics model and combined with Brownian motion optimization


- **SEIR.py, SIR.py, SI.py**

   Simulation of classic infectious disease dynamics model.
- **epidemic_data.xlsx**

   Infectious disease data were recorded.
- **COVID-19_in_HuBei_SEIR.py, COVID-19_in_HuBei_SIR.py**

   The previous data are simulated using SEIR model and SIR model.
- **improved_SEIR.py**

   Optimized SEIR model for the above data for prediction.
- **SEIRwithBrown.py**

   Combining the optimization model of Brownian motion and adding an isolation mechanism.
